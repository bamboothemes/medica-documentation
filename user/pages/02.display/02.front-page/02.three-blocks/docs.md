#### What is this?

In addition to the above settings you need to apply two module classes to enhance the display.

1. Navigate to the Advanced settings module tab
2. Enter "primary nomargin" as the module classes.
	- nomargin further enhances the layout by remove unneeded margins from the module area.
	- The primary class ensures that the background of the boxed item is set to a dark transparency so that the background color of the row underneath will display.
	
#### Blue band of colour beneath the three items
The demo uses the primary-row-nomargin style which uses the colour set in the @primary value at the top of the theme panel.
