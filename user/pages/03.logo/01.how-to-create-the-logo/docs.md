The logo for the Medica template uses a combination of an image and text in a custom html module published to the logo position.

The markup used for the logo in this template is as per the following:

	<h2><a href="../../"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="" /> MEDICA</a>Â </h2>
	
Images published to the logo position are designed to sit to the left of any text displayed in the custom html.
