#### Settings

The settings used for both instances of the map module seen on the demo site can be seen in the screenshot below.

The map on the front page uses the module class " overlay" in order to display the title of the module on top of the map.

The map on the contact page is assigned to the banner position which automatically positions itself underneath the logo and navigation area.
